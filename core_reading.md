The Partition of Bengal and Hindu Terrorism
In 1899 Lord Curzon had assumed duties as the new governor general of India. He resolved to reconcile
Indians to British rule by treating them fairly. “The [Indian National] Congress is tottering to its fall,” he
declared in 1900.
But in 1905 Curzon announced a plan to divide Bengal into two provinces. This made administrative
sense: With 78 million people, Bengal was more populous than the entire United States. Bengali Hindus,
however, viewed the measure as a sinister ploy to fracture the increasingly militant epicenter of Hindu
radicalism, and to create a new province in East Bengal with a Muslim majority. Hindu revivalists who
had been inspired by Chatterji’s accounts of Hindu resistance perceived in Curzon a manifestation of the
British strategy of “divide and conquer”: By dividing Bengal, the British rekindled tensions between
Hindus and Muslims. The Indian National Congress also denounced the partition plan.
Hindu radicals insisted that words of protest were not enough. They first proposed a boycott of all
British-manufactured goods: this swadeshi movement sought to stem the flow of Indian wealth to
Britain. In Poona, in western India, Savarkar, after meeting with Tilak, proposed to collect heaping piles
of British goods and burn them in public squares. These bonfires, illegal and provocative, unsettled the
INC. Mohandas Gandhi, an advocate of human rights in South Africa, warned that a people could never
achieve true liberation through acts of violence. Savarkar replied that liberation would occur no other
way.
By 1907 the Indian National Congress was being pulled in two directions: one, secular and western in
orientation, sought to attain independence through constitutional reform; the other, led by Tilak,
Savarkar and the revivalists, was Hindu and traditionalist; it insisted that Indians would seize control of
the nation only by forceful actions. Tilak proposed to extend the boycott, which had focused on Bengal
and the region around Poona (near Bombay), to all of India. The next year, two Bengalis, intent on
assassinating a harsh British judge, threw a bomb that killed two British women. One of the youths
committed suicide; the other was hanged. Talik wrote searing editorials in defense of both; he was
convicted of sedition and sentenced to six years in prison in Burman.
In 1909 a group of Hindu terrorists who took inspiration, and probably guidance, from V. S. Savarkar,
shot and killed a British tax collector and threw a bomb at Viceroy Lord Minto. Savarkar fled from
London to Paris, when the British ordered his arrest on charges of terrorism and sedition. Savarkar was
captured, shipped to India for trial, and sentenced to 50 years in prison. He was then sent to the British
prison in the Andaman Islands.
The Muslim League
The furor over the partition of Bengal did not just fracture the INC; it unnerved the Muslim leaders of
India. For decades, India’s better-educated Muslims had followed the precepts of Syed Ahmad Khan
(1817-1898), a Muslim scholar who spent much of his life trying to reconcile Muslim beliefs with science
and reason. He disagreed with Muslim clerics who clung to “medieval” superstitions. The Qur’an,
understood properly, was fully compatible with modern science. Khan had disapproved of the Sepoy
mutineers, who sought to plunge India back into the Middle Ages. He urged Indians, and especially the
Muslim leaders, to endorse and uphold British rule. If the British were driven from India, he warned, the
overwhelming Hindu majority would impose their backward religion and culture upon Muslims.
By 1906, Khan’s warnings resonated with force. That year wealthy Muslims responded to the rising tide
of Hindu political activism by forming the All-India Muslim League (hereafter, the Muslim League). Its
purpose was defend Muslims interests and to promote “feelings of loyalty to the British government.”
Muslims, a vulnerable minority, should buttress the British Raj rather than pull it down.
British officials, appreciative of Muslim support, responded favorably to the Muslim League. They
agreed to “protect” Muslims by designating some seats in legislative councils as “reserved” for Muslims.
This special treatment infuriated the INC: the British made no provision for protecting the Hindu
minority in Bengal by reserving Hindu seats for them. Tensions between British and Hindus, and
Muslims and Hindus, smoldered.
