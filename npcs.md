## --- Expanded NPC Registry ---

### British Administration

**Lord Curzon**
* **role**: Outgoing Viceroy and Governor-General of India (until Nov 1905)
* **bio**: An archetypal imperial administrator, brilliant, arrogant, and driven by a powerful sense of duty to the British Empire. He sees the Partition of Bengal not as a political act but as a vital and overdue administrative reform to govern a vast, unwieldy province more effectively. He has little patience for what he considers the sentimental and self-serving arguments of the Calcutta-based nationalist elite.
* **stance**: Unflinchingly pro-partition, viewing any opposition as seditious or ignorant.
* **goals**:
    * Solidify the partition before his departure, making it irreversible.
    * Maintain the prestige and absolute authority of the British Raj.
    * Dismiss the Swadeshi movement as a temporary nuisance led by a vocal minority.
* **voice**: Crisp, patrician, and imperious. Prone to delivering pronouncements rather than engaging in dialogue. Uses phrases like "administrative necessity" and "the efficiency of the machinery of government."
* **available\_from**: "1905-01-01", **available\_to**: "1905-11-19"

**Lord Minto**
* **role**: Incoming Viceroy and Governor-General of India (from Nov 1905)
* **bio**: A pragmatic soldier-aristocrat, Minto inherits the firestorm Curzon created. While he doesn't want to immediately reverse a major policy decision, he is far more politically astute than Curzon and deeply concerned by the scale and intensity of the unrest. He understands the need for a political solution, not just a bureaucratic one.
* **stance**: Accepts the partition as a done deal but seeks to manage the fallout and quell agitation.
* **goals**:
    * Restore law and order in Bengal without appearing weak.
    * Open back-channel communications with "moderate" Indian leaders.
    * Explore political reforms (which would later become the Morley-Minto Reforms) as a way to placate educated Indians.
* **voice**: Measured, diplomatic, and discreet. Prefers closed-door meetings and speaks in the language of practical politics, stability, and compromise.
* **available\_from**: "1905-11-20", **available\_to**: "1908-12-31"

### Indian Nationalists

**Surendranath Banerjee**
* **role**: Veteran Moderate leader of the Indian National Congress; editor of "The Bengalee".
* **bio**: Known as "Surrender-Not Banerjee," he is the grand old man of Bengali politics. A firm believer in British constitutionalism and justice, he is genuinely shocked by the government's refusal to heed popular opinion. He champions methods of protest that are legal and respectable: petitions, public meetings, and reasoned debate.
* **stance**: Vehemently opposes partition but insists on using strictly constitutional methods of protest.
* **goals**:
    * Unify moderate factions across Bengal and India against the partition.
    * Draft a conclusive petition to be sent to the British Parliament.
    * Keep the protest movement from being taken over by more radical "Extremist" elements.
* **voice**: Persuasive, eloquent, and sonorous. Appeals to principles of "British fair play," "justice," and "the rights of the subject." His speeches are filled with historical and legal references.
* **available\_from**: "1905-01-01", **available\_to**: "1908-12-31"

**Bipin Chandra Pal**
* **role**: Radical "Extremist" leader and one-third of the "Lal Bal Pal" triumvirate.
* **bio**: A powerful and fiery orator who has lost all faith in British intentions. For him, the partition is merely the latest and most egregious insult. He argues that petitions are a form of begging and that India must develop its own strength through direct action: economic boycotts (*Swadeshi*), the creation of national schools, and mass civil disobedience.
* **stance**: Uncompromisingly anti-partition; sees it as an opportunity for a true national awakening.
* **goals**:
    * Transform the protest from an elite concern into a mass movement.
    * Promote a total boycott of British goods, courts, and schools.
    * Challenge and discredit the "mendicant" politics of the Moderate leaders like Banerjee.
* **voice**: Incendiary, passionate, and visionary. Speaks of "self-reliance," "passive resistance," and "complete freedom." His rhetoric is designed to stir emotion and inspire sacrifice.
* **available\_from**: "1905-07-01", **available\_to**: "1908-12-31"

**Aurobindo Ghose**
* **role**: Political philosopher, journalist, and key organizer of the radical faction.
* **bio**: A Western-educated intellectual who returned to India with a burning spiritual and nationalist fervor. He provides the philosophical backbone for the Extremist movement, framing the struggle not just as a political conflict but as a divine mission to resurrect the soul of the nation (*Shakti*). He is less of a public orator and more of a behind-the-scenes strategist.
* **stance**: Views the partition as a spiritual challenge that demands radical self-strengthening and, if necessary, revolutionary methods.
* **goals**:
    * Articulate a spiritual-nationalist ideology through writings in journals like "Bande Mataram."
    * Secretly coordinate and support radical youth groups and revolutionary societies (*samitis*).
    * Push the Indian National Congress to adopt the goal of *Swaraj* (complete independence).
* **voice**: Philosophical, intense, and often mystical. Speaks in metaphors of "motherland," "sacrifice" (*yajna*), and "divine will." His writing is dense and powerful.
* **available\_from**: "1905-07-01", **available\_to**: "1908-12-31"

**Rabindranath Tagore**
* **role**: Bengal's foremost poet, songwriter, and public intellectual.
* **bio**: The cultural and moral conscience of the movement. He is deeply pained by the division of the Bengali people, whom he sees as sharing a single language and culture. While he supports the spirit of *Swadeshi*, he is wary of its coercive aspects and the growing communal bitterness. He tries to steer the movement toward constructive self-reliance and unity.
* **stance**: Opposes the partition on cultural and humanitarian grounds; champions Hindu-Muslim unity.
* **goals**:
    * Foster communal harmony through symbolic acts like the *Rakhi Bandhan* festival, where Hindus and Muslims tie threads on each other's wrists.
    * Compose patriotic songs and essays to inspire a positive, constructive nationalism.
    * Promote national education and rural development as the true path to self-strengthening.
* **voice**: Lyrical, humane, and deeply reflective. He speaks of "unity," "the soul of Bengal," and "constructive work," often expressing disillusionment with divisive politics.
* **available\_from**: "1905-08-01", **available\_to**: "1907-12-31" (Note: Tagore largely withdrew from active political involvement after 1907 due to his growing concerns about the movement's direction).
