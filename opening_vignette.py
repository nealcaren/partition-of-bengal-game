**PARTITION ANNOUNCEMENT CONFIRMED OCTOBER 16 STOP EXPECT VIGOROUS NATIVE RESPONSE STOP CURZON DIRECTS YOU PREPARE GROUND STOP DISCRETION YOURS STOP**

Your bearer has already placed three files on your breakfast table:

**URGENT** — Police Commissioner seeks approval for preemptive arrests of "seditious elements"  
**PENDING** — Surendranath Banerjee requests meeting re: constitutional petition  
**COMMERCIAL** — Proposal to fund Bengali textile mills (undercut swadeshi appeal?)

Outside your window, Calcutta is waking. 78 million Bengalis are about to learn their province will be split in two.

You have eight weeks to shape how they receive the news.""",

*"College Square organizing committees growing bolder. Bipin Chandra Pal addressed 3,000 last Thursday—'foreign cloth is a chain around our necks.' Aurobindo Ghose's journal publishes bomb-making chemistry alongside Bankim's hymns. We have names. Recommend immediate action."*

Clipped to the back: twelve arrest warrants, unsigned.

But there's a second memo, from your deputy:

*"Sir—Banerjee's moderates control Congress. Arrest their rivals and we make martyrs. Banerjee himself has requested audience. He'll propose petitions, deputations, constitutional methods. We can channel dissent through him—if we don't poison the well first."*

Two paths. The police want preemptive strikes. Your deputy wants to co-opt the moderates.

And beneath both memos, a note in Lord Curzon's hand: *"The Partition is administrative necessity. But Bengal produces poets and revolutionaries in equal measure. Steady hand required."*""",

**Red pins** — Hindu nationalist strongholds. Calcutta, Dacca University, the vernacular press. Here they're calling the Partition *Banga Bhanga*—"the Breaking of Bengal." They see cultural dismemberment.

**Green pins** — Muslim-majority districts in the east. At Ahsan Manzil, Nawab Salimullah has quietly welcomed the news. A Muslim-majority province means canal funding, educational grants, political weight. Your intelligence notes: *"Muslim League forming to protect community interests should Congress radicalize."*

**Blue pins** — British commercial interests. Manchester textile importers, Calcutta jute traders, the Port Trust. They need stability. Boycotts mean lost revenue.

The Partition will split Bengal into:
- **Eastern Bengal & Assam** — Muslim-majority, capital at Dacca
- **Bengal** — Hindu-majority, centered on Calcutta

On paper, it's about governing 78 million people more efficiently. Revenue collection. Administrative reach.

You close the file. Outside, the first hawkers are setting up in College Square. The *Amrita Bazar Patrika* will hit the streets in an hour. Surendranath Banerjee is probably already drafting his petition.

And in some basement printing press, Aurobindo Ghose is writing tomorrow's editorial.

- Allocating discretionary funds for grants, infrastructure, concessions
- Signaling to Indian elites who is in favor, who is suspect

A successful transition means advancement. Perhaps the governorship of Bombay. Recognition in London.

A botched one means career ruin—or worse, being the man who ignited rebellion across Britain's richest province.

**STABILITY** — Are the streets calm? Are courts functioning? Or have strikes, riots, and disorder made the province ungovernable?

**SWADESHI MOMENTUM** — The boycott movement grows weekly. Bonfires of British cloth. *Swadeshi* mills opening. If it becomes unstoppable, the Partition itself becomes untenable.

You will be **dismissed** if:
- **Legitimacy collapses** (score under 20) — administrators and elites conclude you've lost control
- **Stability collapses** (score under 20) — riots overwhelm provincial authority  
- **Swadeshi Momentum becomes unstoppable** (score above 85) — the boycott makes the Partition unworkable

You will **succeed** if you reach **31 December 1908** without triggering any of those crises.

**3. Commerce Department proposal**  
₹50,000 in grants to Bengali textile mills. Undercut the *swadeshi* appeal by funding indigenous industry. But will it look like a bribe?

What is your decision?
