"The Partition will be announced within weeks," he says. "Bengal is unwieldy—78 million souls, impossible to govern effectively. We're creating two provinces: a Muslim-majority east with its capital at Dacca, and a Hindu-majority west centered on Calcutta."

On paper, it's administrative reform. The files cite population density, revenue collection challenges, the difficulty of managing such vast territory.

But you've read the intelligence reports. You know what the Bengali press is saying.""",

**The Englishman** (British-owned): "Lord Curzon's masterstroke will bring efficient governance to India's most populous province."

**Amrita Bazar Patrika** (Bengali nationalist): "The Partition is a dagger aimed at Bengali unity—splitting Hindu from Muslim, severing our cultural heartland."

**The Bengalee** (edited by Surendranath Banerjee): "Partition invites profound disappointment, yet our response must remain constitutional—petitions, not bombs."

But there are newer voices too. Younger men—Bipin Chandra Pal, Aurobindo Ghose—speak of *swadeshi* (own-country), of boycotting British goods entirely. Of meeting foreign rule not with petitions, but with resistance.

The question everyone whispers: Is this really about administration? Or is it "divide and rule"?""",

In College Square, Congress volunteers organise *swadeshi* pickets. Across the Hugli in Howrah, police intelligence notes handbills extolling bomb-makers. Newspapers quote Bankim Chandra’s hymns to a motherland that must be defended by deed, not debate.

Yet the tide is not wholly Hindu. At Ahsan Manzil, Nawab Salimullah assures visitors that a Muslim-majority province will finally see canal projects funded; Syed Ahmad Khan’s disciples warn that a reckless agitation may leave their community exposed should the Raj give way. Telegrams mention a “Muslim league” in gestation to steady the ship.

Every decision you take will shift the balance between these camps. Appease one, and the others read betrayal.""",

He needs you to manage what comes next. The official announcement. The inevitable protests. The competing factions within the Indian political class—moderates who still believe in petitions and constitutional reform, and extremists who speak openly of driving the British from India.

"You'll have broad discretion," Curzon continues. "Suppress sedition, certainly. But also—consider concessions where prudent. Industrial grants, educational reforms, consultation with loyal elements. We must maintain order without igniting rebellion."

He pauses at the door. "The Partition is administrative necessity. But Bengal is... passionate. Literate. They produce poets and revolutionaries in equal measure. Don't let it become a spark."

**Legitimacy** — Does the British administration maintain credibility with Indian elites and the wider public?

**Local Stability** — Can you prevent the situation from tipping into riots, strikes, or violence?

**Swadeshi Momentum** — The boycott movement is growing. Will you contain it, redirect it, or concede ground?

**Reputation** — In London and Delhi, are you judged a steady hand or a liability to imperial governance?

The game will surface the dilemmas facing colonial administrators: balancing moderate petitions against radical plots, judging British divide-and-rule calculations, and tracking how Muslim loyalists respond to each signal you send.

History remembers that the Partition was annulled in 1911. Your decisions will show why.""",

STARTING_SCENARIO = """
**Calcutta, August 1905**

Your first morning briefing arrives. The Partition announcement is set for October. Between now and then, you must shape the ground.

Your desk holds:
- **Intelligence reports** on organizing committees in Calcutta colleges
- **Memoranda** from moderate leaders requesting audience with the Viceroy  
- **Police recommendations** for preemptive restrictions on public meetings
- **A proposal** from the Commerce Department for grants to indigenous industries

The city watches. Merchants whisper of boycott. What is your first move?
